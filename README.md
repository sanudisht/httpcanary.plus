HttpCanary+ is an enhanced modification of the original HttpCanary v3.3.6, a popular tool for capturing and inspecting HTTP/HTTPS traffic on Android devices. Designed for developers, testers, and researchers, it unlocks all premium features, removes usage restrictions, and introduces improvements to bypass VPN detection and app-level blocking. With these enhancements, HttpCanary+ offers a more powerful and flexible experience than the standard version or other mods available online.
