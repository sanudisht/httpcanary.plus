- What is HttpCanary+?

HttpCanary+ is a modified and enhanced version of the original HttpCanary v3.3.6 app.
HttpCanary is a powerful network packet capture and inspection tool used by developers,
testers, and researchers to analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic on Android devices.

While the original app offers a solid feature set, many advanced functions are locked behind
a paywall, and certain apps can detect and block traffic inspection through VPN detection
and security mechanisms.

HttpCanary+ solves these problems by offering full functionality without restrictions and
introducing new modifications that make it superior to other HttpCanary mods available online.
